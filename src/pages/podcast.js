        <p>
          In September of 2017, I came up with the idea for a new podcast.
          People often asked me about my career change from pastor to
          programming. I realized that others might benefit from listening to
          similar stories. So I set out to find great stories of people making
          career changes to web development and software engineering. My
          favorite part is finding and sharing those lessons that could have
          only been learned by following the alternative path they took. Thus,{' '}
          <SCDLink>Second Career Devs</SCDLink> was born, and I'm so glad to
          share it with you.
