I go over [function composition in this blog post](/just-enough-fp-composition), so please read the post for a more detailed explanation.

```javascript
const compose =
  (...fns) =>
  x =>
    fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x)

const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  x =>
    fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x)
```

If you want to get real fancy, you can split out and share the reducer.

```javascript
const apply = (value, fn) => fn(value)

const compose =
  (...fns) =>
  x =>
    fns.reduceRight(apply, x)

const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  x =>
    fns.reduce(apply, x)
```
