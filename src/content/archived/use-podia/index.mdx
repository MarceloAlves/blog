**Update May 30, 2020**: This update will change the tone of the content below and I apologize for that. In roughly a week, I'll simply unpublish this post to reduce potential future confusion.

I have had to pull my courses from Podia for the time being. They will continue to be on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

I still plan to make content to sell directly to you. Podia will be a part of that. And when I'm ready to re-launch again, I'll have new deals for you. It has been a long term goal of mine to learn how to create and run a business of my own, and I will not be giving up that pursuit.

This is just a bump in the road. I minor setback that will seem like nothing in the long run. I want to thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate it.

You probably know that I have video courses and lessons on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io). What you might _not_ know is instructors maintain the rights to the content that they put on egghead. This gives instructors the freedom to do more with their content if they choose to, and I've been thinking about doing something more with mine for a while now.

I believe there are people who are uncomfortable with buying an egghead subscription <Marker content="It's totally worth the money. Even at full price." /> that would prefer to buy educational content on an individual course, or even an individual _module_, basis. <Marker content="I know because I'm one of them. Your course may be worth $300, but I only want sections 3 & 4 and I'd pay you $150 if you gave me the option." />

I also believe there are people who would also be interested in more directly supporting me and my work. I know there are people out there who really take pride in knowing they support quality content creators directly.

I want to make sure all of these groups of people, and others I have not yet considered, have an alternative option to access my content and material. To make this happen, some of my work will be available for purchase on Podia in the near future.

### Exciting New Possibilities

There are a few things that excite me about starting to make content directly available to you. All of these options provide me with more support and you with more value.

#### Presales

One of the challenging things about making courses is paying all of the cost upfront. My last course took about 150-200 hours of prep to study and create all the material for a video course, an online workshop, and more. While it was financially worth it in the end, it's a bit hard to know it will be while you're making it. What if it didn't have to be this way?

A new trend in marketing and content creation is "presales" and I think this is a great option for me. The basic idea is people pay a discounted price for a product while it's still unfinished, as you near completion, the price gradually increases to launch price. The creator gets revenue and validation about their product with the option to make adjustments as the content is being made to bring better value to customers. The customer gets early access to material they want at a better value. It really is a win-win for both parties.

#### Ebooks, Online Workshops & More

Podia is already designed for someone like me to be able to sell other content, like ebooks and online workshops, directly to you. Both of these will provide me more opportunities create and provide better educational content for you.

I'll be able to create a workshop that actually walks people through the content of my courses and answer questions in real time. Or write a book that covers a much larger swath of material than a single blog post. I hope you're as excited as I am about the possibilities.

### What Does this Mean for egghead and Your Content?

Absolutely nothing changes about my content on egghead nor will I stop creating content for egghead. In fact, any video lesson course I create in the future will still be in the egghead-style and I plan to put it on the egghead platform.

Simply put, I love egghead and what they've done for me. Truth be told, without [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) in my life, I would never even _believe_ I am capable of selling content to people. It's because of his mentoring that I even have the idea and courage to try.

egghead has an amazing platform of people and I want to continue to provide quality content for them. Starting a platform of my own, though, is a natural extension of the work I'm doing here with this blog, my [newsletter](/newsletter) and the many ideas I have that I want to share with you in the future.

And now I have the option to generate more content options, which will be a benefit to all people interested in the content. I am convinced it's a situation where there are no losers.
