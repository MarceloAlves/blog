Over the last year, I've put a lot of time and effort into learning Ember and building JSON APIs with Rails. While I've built a few tiny applications here and there, I have yet to build anything substantial with these tools. Since I would like to find an Ember job and it would be helpful for me to have some more Ember code on my Github profile, I have decided that now is the time to start building a sizable application.

I have been toying around with the idea of building a project tracker for a while now. At my current job, we have several applications to cover all the pieces for tracking the build of a project and I think these processes can be simplified, improved, and brought into the same application. I know that there are other project trackers out there, perhaps some great ones; but this one will be mine, and not only will it allow me to build an application from scratch, but it will give me the opportunity to practice iterating and improving upon an idea.

The codename for the project is Tempo. I like the idea of "keeping time" as a metaphor for project planning, plus I have some inclination to remove specific time ranges (such as weeks and days) and replace them with relative time ranges and creating a process that allows you to monitor the tempo of your project. Too fast a tempo, i.e. too many tasks with too little time, and you have a frenetic pace; too few tasks for the time alloted, maybe it's time to spin up another project or start buckling down and be more aggressive with the current project. Get it?

My plan is to blog briefly about my process, perhaps share some of the code that I am writing along the way. I think there might be a thing or two that I learn that could be useful to other devs. I'm always looking for ways to help out.

So be on the lookout for new posts about Tempo. I'd like to get an minimum viable product built within the month.
