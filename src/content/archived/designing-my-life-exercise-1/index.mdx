I recently bought the book "Designing Your Life" by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. It's about applying the principles of design to your life, specifically, improving one's life through prototyping and iteration. As I read the book, I plan to blog and vlog about the exercises.

Truth be told, it takes me quite a bit of time to write longer posts due to editing, so I got really lazy and made a vlog of the first exercise. I may come back and write a piece to go here. I feel bad for those who are hearing impaired and would like to participate.

Until I overcome my guilt and laziness, please take a look and listen to the vlog episode.
