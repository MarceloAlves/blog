Folks, I started a new job on Monday working for [FINE Design Group](http://www.finedesigngroup.com) here in Portland. I'm officially a web developer! Well, at least my job title says that. I still got a lot to learn. In fact, I need to learn:

- Git (especially the cmd line)
- SVN
- Rails

This should keep me busy for a while!

Share with me any resources you might have for someone on these topics! Thanks.
