A while back I created a set of Sublime Text snippets for Susy 2 mixins and functions. This past week, I made that collection of snippets into a Package Control package.

If you haven't already installed the snippets, you can do it now by searching for "Susy 2 Snippets" with Sublime Text's Package Control. Here's the link to the package: [https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Susy%202%20Snippets](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Susy%202%20Snippets)
