You might be wondering why I've been so quiet these last few weeks. I haven't been blogging much and I certainly haven't written any music in a while. There's a very simple explanation. I got a new job.

#### What? Where? When?

All good questions. I am now working as a junior web developer for [FINE Design Group](http://www.finedesigngroup.com) in Downtown Portland. I started on November 11th, or as I like to call it, [Armistice Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day).

I'll be building websites and web apps for them during the day and working on rocking music and any other projects I have going on at night. Sure, I won't have the immeasurable freedom that comes with unemployment any longer, but I'll have a paycheck, and that's a different sort of freedom. Be ready for some new awesome stuff coming your way once I get this whole work/life balance thing a bit figured out.
