I was invited by [Max Mautner](https://twitter.com/maxmautner) to join him on his podcast, [Accidental Engineer](https://theaccidentalengineer.com). I had a great time sharing my story of going from pastor to programmer. We also talked a bit about my podcast and where I see the future of our industry heading. I hope you'll give it a listen!
