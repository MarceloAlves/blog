import { DiceRoll, Form1 } from './_components.tsx'

As I've gotten older, I find myself arguing less often and discussing code more in terms of preferences than absolutes. That should indicate how strongly I feel about this.

I need our community as a whole to stop calling `new Date()` and other impure functions inside our components, especially when setting initial state. <Marker content="Yes, there are probably times where it is safe to do so, but you should have a really good understanding of pure and impure functions before you do." /> You're making life harder for yourself.

I have a simple React component, a single date input that defaults to today's date.

```jsx
// A simple way to set a new Date() to 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
// but use whatever method or lib you prefer
function formatDate(date: Date) {
  return date.toISOString().split('T')[0]
}

function MyDateInput() {
  const today = formatDate(new Date())
  const [date, setDate] = React.useState(today)

  return (
    <label>
      <span>Date</span>

      <input
        type="date"
        onChange={e => {
          setDate(e.target.value)
        }}
        value={date}
      />
    </label>
  )
}
```

You can see it in action here:

<Form1 client:load />

Ask yourself a question: **How would you visually regression test this?**

The answer is **you don't**. Not in its current state.

Every time this component is first rendered for testing, the date will (potentially) be different. This is the definition of a flaky test. When I first arrived at one of my previous companies, they had a date input similar to this that they simply updated _every single time the Chromatic visual regression test ran_. It was extremely disappointing to see.

The reason this changes should be obvious, but for the sake of providing all context possible, it happens because `new Date()` is an impure function. Every time we call it, we get a different response. That's essentially the opposite of what we want to have happen in a test. In a test, we want the same inputs to always produce the same outputs.

Because we're calling an impure function in our component, our component itself has become impure. How do we fix this?

By passing the impure function (or the result of the impure function) in as a prop instead.

```jsx
function MyDateInput({ today }) {
  const [date, setDate] = React.useState(today)

  return (
    <label>
      <span>Date</span>

      <input
        type="date"
        onChange={e => {
          setDate(e.target.value)
        }}
        value={date}
      />
    </label>
  )
}

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <MyDate today={formatDate(new Date())} />
    </form>
  )
}
```

Now, testing is dead simple, just pass any formatted date into it.

```javascript
test('MyDateInput', () => {
  const result = render(<MyDateInput today="2024-08-20" />)
  const input = result.getByLabelText('Date')

  expect(input.value).toEqual('2024-08-20')
})
```

**Note** that this allows us to pass in a _static_ date into a visual regression test, eliminating the issue of a new date being rendered each time we build the suite.

### A step further

I like to take this pattern a step further and use [default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) in this situation. The most common use case of our input will be passing in `formatDate(new Date())`, so we should just bake it in for a better developer experience.

```jsx
function MyDateInput({ today = formatDate(new Date()) }) {
  const [date, setDate] = React.useState(today)

  return (
    <label>
      <span>Date</span>

      <input
        type="date"
        onChange={e => {
          setDate(e.target.value)
        }}
        value={date}
      />
    </label>
  )
}
```

Now, we have the best of both worlds. We have a component we can treat as a pure function by passing the `today` prop in, or we can make use of the default. I think of this as a form of [dependency injection](/dependency-injection-and-default-parameters) and have covered the topic before.

### Let's make another example

Another common impure function you might see in components (or functions in general) is `Math.random()`. For these instances, I like to use a `randomizer` argument, with `Math.random` set to the default. Consider a `DiceRoll` component.

```jsx
const rollDice = () => Math.ceil(Math.random() * 6)

function DiceRoll() {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(rollDice())

  const roll = () => {
    setState(rollDice())
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={roll}>Roll dice</button>
      <Dice number={state} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, I've made this component with a bit of indirection, extracting the `rollDice` function, but our same principles apply. `rollDice` is an impure function because of `Math.random`, therefore `DiceRoll` is an impure component because of `rollDice`. Let's make both `rollDice` and our component pure functions with default parameters.

```jsx
const rollDice = (randomizer = Math.random) => Math.ceil(randomizer() * 6)

function DiceRoll({ randomizer = Math.random }) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(rollDice(randomizer))

  const roll = () => {
    setState(rollDice(randomizer))
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={roll}>Roll dice</button>
      <Dice number={state} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, we could easily write unit and integration tests for our functions.

```javascript
test('rollDice', () => {
  // We do need to pass in a `randomizer` that returns values
  // in the range of Math.random
  expect(rollDice(() => 0.01)).toEqual(1)
  expect(rollDice(() => 0.99)).toEqual(6)
})

test('DiceRoll', () => {
  const result = render(<DiceRoll randomizer={() => 0.99} />)

  // `getByText` or whatever way we need to check the value of the dice
  expect(result.getByText(6)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

<DiceRoll client:load />

### Wrap up

We don't want to set initial state with impure functions in our components. It makes testing difficult. Instead, pass in the impure function (or its result) as an argument/prop. This will will give us the ability to pass in a pure function as a substitute in a test.
