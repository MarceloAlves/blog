import ItemSelectorBad from './_ItemSelectorBad'

This one will be short and sweet. <Marker content="At least I thought so when I started writing this, and I have no intention of changing the sentence now" /> You're using React. You have some state.

```javascript
const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = React.useState(null)
```

You're already on board with the concepts in [useEncapsulation](/use-encapsulation) and [Prefer Declarative State Updaters](/prefer-declarative-state-updaters), so you make a custom hook combining your state with the functions that will update that state.

```javascript
function useItemSelection() {
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = React.useState(null)

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      selectItem: item => {
        setSelectedItem(item)
      },
      unselectItem: () => {
        setSelectedItem(null)
      },
    }),
    [],
  )

  return [selectedItem, handlers]
}
```

Fantastic. Your selection logic is encapsulated in a nice, little custom hook. Your boss and colleagues love you and your code. All is well in the world!

Until...

You get some new requirements.

"We would love it if clicking on the **currently selected item** would **unselect** the item, rather than do nothing. Can you do that?"

Of course we can! But the question is how shall we do it? There are at minimum, two ways. Let's do it the less-than-great way first.

In order to "unselect" an item, we need to know that the item we're selecting is the same as current `selectedItem`. We could use the `selectedItem` that's in scope.

```javascript
function useItemSelection() {
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = React.useState(null)

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      // ...same handlers as before

      smartSelectItem: item => {
        // Here we use `selectedItem` from the parent scope
        // We're _also_ assuming the "items" have an `id`
        // We will fix that later
        if (item?.id === selectedItem?.id) {
          setSelectedItem(null)
          return
        }

        setSelectedItem(item)
      },
    }),
    // Now we had to add `selectedItem` as a dependency
    // All handlers will update _every_ time `selectedItem` updates
    [selectedItem],
  )

  return [selectedItem, handlers]
}
```

We can pop this into a component and see that it works.

<OffsetWrap>
  <ItemSelectorBad client:load />
</OffsetWrap>

Great, this works as expected. Why is it less-than-great?

Because we're relying on a dependency we don't need to rely on, and in so doing, we're forcing our state updaters to change unnecessarily.

If we use a "function updater" instead of relying on the `selectedItem` in scope, we can avoid the `selectedItem` dependency entirely.

```javascript
const handlers = React.useMemo(() => {
  // ...same handlers as before, except...
  smartSelectItem: item => {
    setSelectedItem(currentItem => {
      if (item?.id === currentItem?.id) return null
      return item
    })
  }
}, [])
```

Now we no longer have a dependency because React is giving us all the information we need to determine the next state within the state setter itself. On top of that, we get a tidy little, almost [pattern matching like](/pattern-matching) function body. The fact that each branch of logic must return the `nextState` helps us in other ways. I've made the following bug a few times in my career: <Marker content="And lost a few hours here and there yelling at my computer about it. <span>ðŸ˜…</span>" />

```javascript
{
  smartSelectItem: item => {
    if (item?.id === selectedItem?.id) {
      setSelectedItem(null)
    }

    setSelectedItem(item)
  }
}
```

See my mistake?

I forgot to `return` in the guard statement. Classic.

### Other Benefits

Hooks solved a lot of problems, but they didn't get rid of a few "gotchas". In fact, `useState` created an _extra_ gotcha you didn't have to deal with in class component days. Let's start there:

#### Object updates are not merged anymore

In the class component days, you could create a state like this:

```javascript
this.state = {
  error: null,
  data: null,
  loading: false,
}
```

And you could do updates like this:

```javascript
this.setState({ loading: true })
```

And your `state` would be:

```javascript
console.log(this.state) // { error: null, data: null, loading: true }
```

But try this with a hook instead:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useState({
  error: null,
  data: null,
  loading: false,
})

setState({ loading: true })

console.log(state) // { loading: true }
```

**What?!** That's right, objects aren't merged. They are _replaced_.

I personally think this makes sense. By making the state setter more rudimentary, the API becomes straightforward. No longer do you need to know about the "behavior" of the state setter. It's less information you need to store in memory, and I'm a big fan of that.

You can get around this using function updaters:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useState({
  error: null,
  data: null,
  loading: false,
})

setState(currentState => ({
  ...currentState,
  loading: true,
}))

console.log(state) // { error: null, data: null, loading true }
```

#### Calling state setters more than once in a handler body

This "gotcha" has also been true since the class component days. If you call a state setter more than once in the same function body, there's a _really_ good chance that the update will not be what you expect when that function body completes.

Here's an absurd example, with a `useTripleCounter` hook:

```javascript
function useTripleCount() {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(0)

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      inc: () => {
        setState(state + 1)
        setState(state + 1)
        setState(state + 1)
      },
      dec: () => {
        setState(state - 1)
        setState(state - 1)
        setState(state - 1)
      },
    }),
    [state],
  )

  return [state, handlers]
}
```

If I use this in a component, what's going to happen? All three `setState`s are going to be called, utilizing the same `state` dependency and `state` will only change by a value of `1`. Not to mention, our `handlers` update every single time `state` updates, which may lead to more rerenders than necessary.

But, if we swap those updates for function updaters:

```javascript
const handlers = React.useMemo(
  () => ({
    inc: () => {
      // often I shorten `state` to just `s` when the update is this small
      setState(s => s + 1)
      setState(s => s + 1)
      setState(s => s + 1)
    },
    dec: () => {
      setState(s => s - 1)
      setState(s => s - 1)
      setState(s => s - 1)
    },
  }),
  [],
)
```

What happens now? Now our updates are all applied. Our count increments and decrements by `3`. I hope you can see how this might be useful in a _real_ situation. <Marker content="Though I might recommend you find a way to <em>not</em> call a state setter multiple times in the same function body instead." />

### Summary

Using function updaters leads to fewer gotchas and requires fewer dependencies than simply replacing the current state. Consider using them more often to improve your stateful React components.

### Bonus: Improving the `useItemSelection` hook

I wanted to take a moment and make this hook a little better before finishing the post. This relates to my recent post on [dependency injection](dependency-injection-and-default-parameters) which you should read.

Did you happen to notice _another_ dependency in the `useItemSelection` hook? Here it is in full so you can look for it:

```javascript
function useItemSelection() {
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = React.useState(null)

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      selectItem: item => {
        setSelectedItem(item)
      },
      unselectItem: () => {
        setSelectedItem(null)
      },
      smartSelectItem: item => {
        setSelectedItem(currentItem => {
          if (item?.id === currentItem?.id) return null
          return item
        })
      },
    }),
    [],
  )

  return [selectedItem, handlers]
}
```

Hopefully you recognized that `smartSelectItem` knows a _bit_ too much about the shape of the items being selected. What if these items are _not_ objects? What if they are but don't have `id`s, but some other key?

Let's use dependency injection and a default parameter to fix this:

```javascript
const tryId = x => x?.id

function useItemSelection(getKey = tryId) {
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = React.useState(null)

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      selectItem: item => {
        setSelectedItem(item)
      },
      unselectItem: () => {
        setSelectedItem(null)
      },
      smartSelectItem: item => {
        setSelectedItem(currentItem => {
          if (getKey(item) === getKey(currentItem)) return null
          return item
        })
      },
    }),
    [getKey],
  )

  return [selectedItem, handlers]
}
```

Now `useItemSelection` is a bit more flexible. Perhaps you want to use `name` as a key instead:

```javascript
const [state, handlers] = useItemSelection(x => x?.name)
```

No longer does `useItemSelection` force your data into a shape. You can easily conform `useItemSelection` to your data.
