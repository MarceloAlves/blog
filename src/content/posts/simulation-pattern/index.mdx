**Disclaimer**: If this pattern has an established name, let me know. I'll update the article to reflect that.

In December, <Marker content="And some of January..." /> I participated in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). It was _mostly_ fun, but I did have some _extremely_ difficult days. If you follow me on Twitter, you know of my travails with day 19. Oof.

That said, there was a common pattern I used to solve several of the puzzles that I want to share with you. I call it the **"simulation pattern"** and if I hadn't tried to learn the _tiniest_ amount of game dev a few years back, I may have never learned it. Thus, I want to pass it on to you in the hopes you find it useful.

### What is a &ldquo;simulation&rdquo;?

A "simulation", in my own words, is where we create some conditions and store some state, and then add a `tick` method to advance that state to the next discrete increment. [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is an excellent example of a simulation and I encourage you to take this pattern and try to build Conway's Game of Life with it when you're done reading this post.

### The pieces of the pattern

In its most basic form, a simulation is a [closure](/what-is-a-closure) which exposes a `tick` method to advance to the next state. Using a [factory function](/what-is-a-factory-function), it looks like this:

```javascript
function createSimulation(initialState) {
  let state = initialState

  return {
    tick() {
      // Add functionality to update state
    },
    getState() {
      return state
    },
  }
}

const sim = createSimulation()
sim.tick()
sim.getState()
```

We create a function that holds our `state` in closure. We add functionality in our exposed `tick` method to advance the state, and we create a way to access the current state with `getState`. All simulations are some variation of this pattern.

Let's create a simple example to demonstrate this. All of us have to deal with money in some capacity, so a loan payoff calculator can be a useful tool to have. We can create a simulation that takes in a `principal`, an `interestRate`, and expose a `tick` method that receives a `payment` to determine how many payments are necessary to pay off a loan.

First, let's create our factory function:

```javascript
function createLoanPayoffSimulation(principal, interestRate) {
  let total = principal

  return {
    tick(payment) {
      const interest = total * interestRate

      if (payment <= interest) {
        throw new Error('Impossible to pay off loan. Increase payment amount.')
      }

      const diff = interest - payment
      total += diff

      return this
    },
    getTotal() {
      return total
    },
  }
}

// Dividing by 12 gives us a monthly interest rate
const sim = createLoanPayoffSimulation(10000, 0.05 / 12)
```

Now that we have our simulation, we can create a function that uses a simulation to determine how many payments are needed to payoff the loan.

```javascript
function getTotalPayments(payoffSimulation, payment) {
  let payments = 0
  let paid = false

  while (!paid) {
    payoffSimulation.tick(payment)
    payments++

    const total = payoffSimulation.getTotal()
    paid = total <= 0
  }

  return payments
}

console.log(getTotalPayments(sim, 500)) // 21
```

We can pass different simulations with different conditions into `getTotalPayments` to solve other loan payoff scenarios.

Now that you've seen the basics, give it a try on some other problems. Or try it on an Advent of Code problem, [like this one](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5).

You can also use [generator functions](/generator-functions) to create a similar effect, just with `next` as the method instead of `tick`. The difference being that you `yield` the next state with each run of the function. I make a loan payment calculator in that post as well, so you can hopefully compare the two.
