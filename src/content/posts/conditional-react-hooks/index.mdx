You want to conditionally call a hook, but you can't do that because of [_rules_](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html). What do you do?

The answer is remarkably simple: **Conditionally render a renderless component that uses the custom hook**.

Many years ago, I coined the phrase "renderless component" in [this blog post](/renderless-components). It's a component that uses the lifecycle methods to update app state but has no associated UI. It renders `null`, hence "renderless". These days, replace "lifecycle methods" with "custom hooks", and the same concept applies and, therefore, we can achieve the same result.

If we call a custom hook in a component:

```jsx
function AutoSave({ data }) {
  useAutoSave(data)
  return null
}
```

And then conditionally render that component in another component:

```jsx
function Document({ data, shouldAutoSave }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {shouldAutoSave && <AutoSave data={data} />}
      <div>
        <Editor data={data} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

I can't tell you when or why you may need to do this, but it's a little tool to throw in your toolbelt and pull out when the occasion calls for it.
