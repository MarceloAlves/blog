Recently, I helped a small team fix a performance issue involving React Context. It was a fairly simple fix that I want to share with you. I'm going to set up the problem, show you the small change we needed to make, and share a small library I made to help you out in the future.

### The Problem - Poor composition

To understand this post, we need to establish a shared context (pun intended). We need to understand that whenever state changes in a React app, the component in which the change occurs _will be rerendered_. That means rerendering all the components that are called in that component's function body. Let's make this clear with some examples. I'm going to create a `Box`. The background color for `Box` will change every time it renders. We'll force it to rerender with a `forceUpdate` function:

```jsx
import { Button } from './Button'
import Flex from './Flex'
// A spacing helper function from my shevyjs library
// It's an alias of the `baseSpacing` method
// Spacer uses this under the hood
import { bs } from './shevy'
// These can be found on my snippets page
import randomRGB from './snippets/randomRGB'
import useForceUpdate from './snippets/useForceUpdate'

function Box() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: randomRGB(),
        height: bs(4),
      }}
    />
  )
}

function App() {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return (
    <Flex direction="column" gap={1}>
      <Button onClick={forceUpdate}>Force Update</Button>
      <Box />
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

And we can see it here:

<OffsetWrap>
  <Example1 client:only="react" />
</OffsetWrap>

Perfect. The background color of `Box` changes every time it's rendered and it rerenders due to a state change. Now, let's add React Context to the mix.

Let's create a `Context`, `Provider`, and a custom hook for consuming that context. We're going to use `forceUpdate` as the only `value` passed to the `Provider`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyContext = React.createContext()

function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return <MyContext.Provider value={forceUpdate}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>
}

const useMyContext = () => React.useContext(MyContext)
```

Now, I'm going to **purposely** make a bad choice, and add a `Box` component to `MyProvider`. Notice that `Box` will now be in the same scope that the state change associated with `forceUpdate` occurs (because `forceUpdate` creates a state change inside the `useForceUpdate` hook).

```jsx
function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={forceUpdate}>
      {children}
      <Box />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Now, let's change the `App` a bit, using our new `Context` and custom hook.

```jsx
function Trigger() {
  // Remember that the only value of our context is `forceUpdate`
  // but we purposely want to consume our context at the moment
  const forceUpdate = useMyContext()

  return <Button onClick={forceUpdate}>Force Update</Button>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <Trigger />
    </MyProvider>
  )
}
```

Now, you will notice that the resulting UI is _exactly_ the same. We have a button on top of a box. **Here's the thing to pay attention to**: Typically, only consumers of a context will be forced to rerender when the context `value` updates, but because we made a bad decision and put our `Box` in the same function that has a state change, it's going to rerender, too. Look at it:

<OffsetWrap>
  <Example2 client:only="react" />
</OffsetWrap>

If you're not paying attention, you may be confused why `Box` is rerendering when it doesn't consume your context, but it all has to do with how we chose to make our composition. Let's fix it now.

### The Solution - Only expose `children` in a `Provider`

The problem is we're rendering a component in the same scope as the state change of our context. If we move `Box` from `MyProvider` and into our `App` instead, we'll have the same UI, but `Box` won't rerender when we click the `Trigger`.

```jsx
// No more `Box` in this component
function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return <MyContext.Provider value={forceUpdate}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <Flex direction="column" gap={1}>
        <Trigger />
        <Box />
      </Flex>
    </MyProvider>
  )
}
```

And let's see it in action. Notice, `Box` will not rerender. Click the `Trigger` all you want, it will not change.

<OffsetWrap>
  <Example3 client:only="react" />
</OffsetWrap>

I assure you, a state change is still occurring, but because `Box` is not rendered in the scope of the state change, but rather as one of the `children` of `MyProvider`, it won't rerender. Our UI is _exactly_ the same in all scenarios so far, but we can see how using the correct composition improves how our app functions.

### A More Robust Solution: `react-generate-context`

I'm a believer that if you can put guide rails in place to keep people on a good path, you should use them. When I saw the mistake the team was making, I realized I could build a small package that puts these guide rails in place. Say hello to [`react-generate-context`](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/react-generate-context).

This library is a single function, `generateContext`, that receives a custom hook to manage the `value` for your `Context` and returns to you the `Provider` and custom hook for that context.

The main feature? Because you don't have direct access to the `Provider`, you can't put any other components inside of it.

```javascript
import generateContext from 'react-generate-context'

const [MyProvider, useMyContext] = generateContext(() => {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()
  return forceUpdate
})
```

Notice that the function we pass to `generateContext` is itself a custom hook. We use it to establish the very same value we did before. We can consume `useMyContext` in `Trigger` just like before, too.

To make a slightly better example, and the one you'll find if you visit the [Github page](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/react-generate-context) for it, let's make a `Counter`:

```jsx
const useCounterValue = ({ startingCount = 0 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(startingCount)
  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      inc: () => {
        setState(s => s + 1)
      },
      dec: () => {
        setState(s => s - 1)
      },
    }),
    [],
  )

  return [state, handlers]
}

const [CounterProvider, useCounter] = generateContext(useCounterValue)

function Counter() {
  const [count, { inc, dec }] = useCounter()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={inc}>+</button>
        <button onClick={dec}>-</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <CounterProvider startingCount={100}>
      <Counter />
    </CounterProvider>
  )
}
```

And here it is in action:

<OffsetWrap>
  <Counter client:only="react" />
</OffsetWrap>

Using this package, it's impossible to screw up your `Provider` in a way that creates unnecessary rerenders for components. That's a win in my book.

### Summary

Resist any urge to put other components in the scope of your custom `Provider` for a React Context. Doing so means rerendering those components whenever the state of the context changes. Instead, only expose `children` from your custom `Provider` and compose components under the `Provider`. Using `react-generate-context` removes some of this boilerplate for you.
