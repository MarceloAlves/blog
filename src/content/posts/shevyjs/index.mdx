This morning I released [ShevyJS](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/shevyjs) into the wild. ShevyJS is a remake of [Shevy](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/shevy) for CSS-in-JS styling.

If you're new to the concept of CSS-in-JS, you can find some great resources on the topic including [this massive repo](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js). In a nutshell, CSS-in-JS is the task of adding styles either inline or otherwise directly with JavaScript. You may have seen a `style` tag used in a React component. This was a form of CSS-in-JS.

Now, you can have the mathematics of Shevy's Sass version in your JavaScript client-side framework.

ShevyJS is a class that exposes a set of properties and methods for you to consume throughout your application. Because it is a constructor, you can define as many Shevy configurations you need and pass them around your app with `imports` and `exports`.

It is available on npmjs.org, and be sure to check out the repo at [https://github.com/kyleshevlin/shevyjs](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/shevyjs). If you like the library, please star it.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here, or create an issue on the repository. And share examples of using ShevyJS in the wild.
