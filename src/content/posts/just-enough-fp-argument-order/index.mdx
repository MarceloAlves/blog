In a previous post on [currying](/just-enough-fp-currying), I used a `filter` function in a way that may have left you scratching your head. Not because you were still learning currying, but for other reasons. Let me quickly write that function again for reference in this post:

```javascript
const filter = predicate => array => array.filter(predicate)
```

Our curried filter function receives a `predicate` argument (a `predicate` is a function that returns a boolean) first, partially applies that to the new function returned, and then awaits an `array` to operate upon. What might of had you scratching your head is the order of these arguments. Why did the `predicate` come before the `array`?

That's a good question and the easiest way to find the answer is just to try it. Let's write a `badFilter` function with the argument order swapped:

```javascript
const badFilter = array => predicate => array.filter(predicate)
```

Now, the `array` is the first argument. This might seem more natural to many of you (and looks exactly like Lodash's `_.filter` method). With this order, your brain models it as, "I have an array, this is what I want to do to it." But what's the more reusable piece of that mental model? It's not the data. The data can change at any time. It's ephemeral, but _what we want to do with our data_, that is worth storing and reusing.

With the data argument first, we gain no advantage in partially applying it. We'd be better off just using the built in methods for that data type. And with the data first, we'll never be able to pipe the result of another function into this one. As we'll see in a future post on _composition_, having our data as the final argument is the key to being able to build up functional complexity with composition.

Let's just let the bad example play out a bit:

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const badFilterWithArr1 = badFilter(arr1) // returns a function awaiting a predicate

badFilterWithArr1(n => n % 2 === 0) // [2, 4]
badFilterWithArr1(n => n % 2 !== 0) // [1, 3, 5]
```

That's no more useful than just calling the predicate functions on the the `filter` method of the array.

```javascript
arr1.filter(n => n % 2 === 0) // [2, 4]
```

The wrong argument order immediately negates any benefit we gained through currying and partial application, so it's important that we have our data as our final argument in our functions.

### Rules of Thumb for Argument Order

Here are my general rules for determining argument order. The first "rule", as I just stated, is data comes last. You can bake in a lot of reusable functionality with partial application and pass new data into it over and over with this order.

But what if I have a function that doesn't operate on data, but benefits from partial application and proper argument order?

In that case, the second "rule", and this is really _my way_ of thinking about it, is to order arguments from _most stable_ to _least stable_ argument. What does that mean?

In my previous post on [partial application](/just-enough-fp-partial-application), I used the example of building up a function to fetch data from an API. That function looked like this:

```javascript
const getFromAPI = baseURL => endpoint => callback =>
  fetch(`${baseURL}${endpoint}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => callback(data))
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err)
    })
```

If we examine a REST APIs URLs (so many acronyms, sorry), the part of the URL that changes the least (and in a good API, _never_) is the `baseURL`. If I want to fetch data from Github, I can make a partially applied function like this one:

```javascript
const getFromGithub = getFromAPI('https://api.github.com')
```

This function is really useful! I can build up many endpoints from this one function.

```javascript
const getUsersFromGithub = getFromGithub('/users')
const getReposFromGithub = getFromGithub('/repositories')
const getPublicGistsFromGithub = getFromGithub('/gists/public')
```

The `endpoint` is less stable than the `baseURL`, it changes frequently, but still less frequently than what we want to do with the data once we fetch it. We can do any number of things once we have our users. Thus, the `callback` argument is last because it is the least stable of our arguments.

I'd give you a few examples, but literally you can do almost anything you want with the data once you have it. Use your imagination.

### Conclusion

Argument order in curried functions makes a big difference in how useful and reusable a function is. It's also paramount for enabling composition, as we will see in a future post.
