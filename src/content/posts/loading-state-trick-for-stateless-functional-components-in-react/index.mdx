title: 'Loading State Trick for Stateless Functional Components in React'
---

I want to share with you a little trick I've been using lately with stateless functional components in React. This is probably really old news to some of you, but I'm hoping there are a few of you who don't know this one yet.

If you're getting started with React, and especially if you're using Redux, you've probably come across the concept of container and presentational components.

Container components provide data to nested components. These components will generally use lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount`, to fetch some data and pass it down.

Presentational components, on the other hand, are used solely for displaying data passed into them and generally do not use any lifecycle methods. Often, if a presentational component does not require any lifecycle method (other than the required `render`), then this component is written as a stateless functional component.

A stateless functional component is simply a function that returns the markup (React functions or JSX). Props are passed as arguments to the function, and then utilized within the markup. Let's make a simple example of a stateless functional component that expects an array of items, and displays each one of those items.

```jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'

const DisplayItems = ({ items }) => (
  <div className="items">
    {items.map((item, index) => (
      <div className="item" key={index} {...item} />
    ))}
  </div>
)

Display.propTypes = {
  items: PropTypes.array
}

export default DisplayItems
```

I hope the ES6 doesn't scare you. I've created a function called `DisplayItems`. This function expects a `props` object as an argument, and I'm using ES6 destructuring to make it clear that I'm expecting and will use an `items` property on the `props` object.

Then, I am using the implicit `return` feature of ES6 arrow functions to return the markup (in this case JSX, it's all I really use) from within the body of the function.

Then, I `map` over each item, returning another `div`. React requires that we add a key attribute to items that are dynamically populated, which is often the case with displaying arrays. In this case, it was easy to use the index, but it might be more useful to use a property on the `item` itself in your case.

Lastly, I am using ES6's Object spread syntax to pass all props from `item` into the `div`. In your example, it is possible that this inner item `div` would be another presentational component that needs access to all the `props` on `item`.

Thus, if we used this in our app, regardless of how many `items` we pass to this stateless functional component, React would give us the wrapping `div`, and then any `div`s generated by the map function.

But what if you currently don't have any items _and_ you don't want to display the wrapping `div` until you have `items`?

It is possible to reconfigure this component to display alternative markup if there are no items to display.

Imagine that I have built another component called `LoadingSpinner` which simply shows the user a loading spinner animation. Perhaps it looks something like this:

```jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'

const LoadingSpinner = () => (
  <div className="loading_spinner-wrap">
    <svg
      className="loading_spinner"
      width="60"
      height="20"
      viewBox="0 0 60 20"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    >
      <circle cx="7" cy="15" r="4" />
      <circle cx="30" cy="15" r="4" />
      <circle cx="53" cy="15" r="4" />
    </svg>
  </div>
)

export default LoadingSpinner
```

And maybe I've written some basic styles for it to animate the circles:

```css
.loading_spinner-wrap {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 50px 0;
}

.loading_spinner {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  fill: #000;

  circle {
    animation-name: upAndDown;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.05, 0.2, 0.35, 1);
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;

    &:nth-child(2) {
      animation-delay: 0.18s;
    }

    &:nth-child(3) {
      animation-delay: 0.36s;
    }
  }
}

@keyframes upAndDown {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  25% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
  75% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Now, I can set up my `DisplayList` component to either render the `LoadingSpinner` component, or my list, depending on whether any `items` have been passed to it. Like so:

```jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'
import LoadingSpinner from './LoadingSpinner'

const DisplayItems = ({ items }) => {
  return items.length ? (
    <div className="items">
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <div className="item" key={index} {...item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  ) : (
    <LoadingSpinner />
  )
}

Display.propTypes = {
  items: PropTypes.array
}

export default DisplayItems
```

Did you see what I did there? I removed the implicit return from the `DisplayItems` function, and then used a ternary operator to determine which component gets rendered.

If `items` has any length other than 0, the ternary will evaluate to `true` and thus render our items list. However, if the length of the array is 0, it will evaluate to `false` and render our `LoadingSpinner` component. You might end up with something similar to this:

You could, of course, use any other component that you would prefer to render instead. You can determine what's best for your project, and even what's best per component. But if you're looking for a way to indicate to your users that you're expecting data to eventually make it to your stateless functional component, perhaps this pattern will be useful to you.

Let me know if this is helpful to you in the comments and link to any examples you have of this trick or similar ones. I'd love to see them.
