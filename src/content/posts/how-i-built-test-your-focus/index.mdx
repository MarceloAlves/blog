import { TestYourFocus } from './_components'

[In my previous post](/what-adhd-feels-like-to-me), I use a mini-game as a metaphor for how it feels to have ADHD. I thought we could learn how to build that game with React. Let's get started.

Let's start with defining our component and building out some of the UI. I'm going to break out the parts more than I usually would just for the sake of making it clear which piece is which.

```tsx
import { Button, Heading } from '~/ui'

const METER_HEIGHT = 300 // Adjust to your liking

function Wrap({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        alignItems: 'center',
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'column',
        gap: 16,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

function Meter({ height, value }: { height: number; value: number }) {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        border: '2px solid #e5e5e5',
        height,
        position: 'relative',
        width: 50,
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundColor: '#33a1cc',
          bottom: 0,
          height: `${value}%`,
          left: 0,
          position: 'absolute',
          transition: 'height 66ms ease',
          width: '100%',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

function TestYourFocus() {
  return (
    <Wrap>
      <Heading>Test Your Focus</Heading>

      <Meter height={METER_HEIGHT} value={0} />

      <Button onClick={() => {}}>Click</Button>
    </Wrap>
  )
}
```

Here, we've established the basic units of our mini-game, the power meter that will display the level and the button we'll use to try and move the meter above the threshold.

Now let's try and design the state management of our game. I'm a big fan of using "event-driven" state management in situations like this, so we'll use `useReducer`. You can feel free to replace this with whatever state management you prefer. The concepts will be roughly the same.

The first thing we need for our game is to track a `value`. This value will translate to the current height of the powered up portion of the meter. To that end, you could just as easily name it `power` or `level` or whatever makes sense to you.

```tsx
type State = {
  /**
   * The current value of the meter
   */
  value: number
}

// I always write my "initialState" as a factory function
// so as to ensure I get a new object any time I call it
// and don't accidentally reference the same object in
// different components
const getInitialState = () => ({
  value: 0,
})

// We'll add these soon
type Action = any

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  return state
}
```

We can add that to our component like so:

```tsx
function TestYourFocus() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(getInitialState())

  return (
    <Wrap>
      <Heading>Test Your Focus</Heading>

      <Meter height={METER_HEIGHT} value={state.value} />

      <Button onClick={() => {}}>Click</Button>
    </Wrap>
  )
}
```

Now that we have our `value` wired up, we need to consider how that value changes. We know that when the user clicks the button, the `value` should increase, but how and how much? We also know that we need that value to decay, but what's the mechanism for triggering that?

We're going to use a concept I covered in my [post on simulations](/simulation-pattern) and implement a `TICK` action. With each `TICK`, we'll calculate the next `value`, and utilize `impulse` and `decay` states to do so.

```tsx
type State = {
  /**
   * The rate the value will be decreased each tick
   */
  decay: number
  /**
   * How much the value will be increased with each input
   */
  impulse: number
  /**
   * The current value of the meter
   */
  value: number
}

function getInitialState({
  decay,
  impulse,
}: Pick<State, 'decay' | 'impulse'>): State {
  return {
    decay,
    impulse,
    value: 0,
  }
}

type Action = { type: 'TICK' }

function reducer(state: State, action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'TICK': {
      // We want to clamp the bottom range of our values to 0
      const nextValue = Math.max(0, state.value - state.decay)

      return { state, value: nextValue }
    }

    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

And with this change to `getInitialState`, we can now add `decay` and `impulse` as props to our component, so that we can fiddle with them and make different tests of focus.

```tsx
type Props = Pick<State, 'decay' | 'impulse'>

function TestYourFocus({ decay, impulse }: Props) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(
    getInitialState({ decay, impulse }),
  )

  //...
}
```

So far, we've added the `decay` to our `value`, but we didn't add anything that dispatches our `TICK` action, so let's do that next. We want our `TICK` to occur on an interval, so we'll use `setInterval` in a `useEffect` hook to make this happen.

```tsx
// This will be our interval in ms. You can adjust the
// denominator to increase or decrease the TICK rate
const FPS = 1000 / 15

// In case you're a real stickler about not recreating
// new objects all the time, you can do this
const TICK = { type: 'TICK' }

// ...

function TestYourFocus({ decay, impulse }: Props) {
  //...

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      dispatch(TICK)
    }, FPS)

    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [])

  // ...
}
```

Now, at a rate of roughly 15 times a second, our `TICK` is dispatched and our state updated. The last piece we need to add is an `Action` to add the `impulse` to our value.

```tsx
type Action = { type: 'TICK' } | { type: 'CLICK' }

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    // ...

    case 'CLICK': {
      // Let's clamp the max value at the full height of the meter
      const nextValue = Math.min(100, state.value + state.impulse)

      return { ...state, value: nextValue }
    }

    // ...
  }
}

// ...

function TestYourFocus({ decay, impulse }: Props) {
  // ...

  const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'CLICK' })
  }, [])

  // ...
  return (
    // ...

    <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click</Button>

    // ...
  )
}
```

And now we can play the most rudimentary form of our game.

<TestYourFocus client:load decay={1.5} impulse={10} />

### Optimizations

There are a few quick optimizations we can make to our game. First, as it stands, our `Meter` is re-rendering with every `TICK`, even if we're not playing the game. Let's memoize the component, that way when the `value` is pegged at `0` because we aren't playing, it won't rerender.

```tsx
const Meter = React.memo(function Meter({
  height,
  value,
}: {
  height: number
  value: number
}) {
  //... same implementation
})
```

Second, we're currently sending `TICK`s to our `reducer` 15 times a second, regardless if we are playing or not. Let's add a game `status` to our state and stop `TICK`ing unless it's `running`.

```tsx
type Status = 'idle' | 'running'

type State = {
  decay: number
  impulse: number
  status: Status
  value: number
}

function getInitialState({
  decay,
  impulse,
}: Pick<State, 'decay' | 'impulse'>): State {
  return {
    decay,
    impulse,
    status: 'idle',
    value: 0,
  }
}

// ...

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'TICK': {
      const nextValue = Math.min(0, state.value - state.decay)

      return {
        ...state,
        status: nextValue ? 'running' : 'idle',
        value: nextValue,
      }
    }

    case 'CLICK': {
      const nextValue = Math.max(100, state.value + state.impulse)

      return {
        ...state,
        status: 'running',
        value: nextValue,
      }
    }

    default:
      return state
  }
}

// ...

function TestYourFocus({ decay, impulse }: Props) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(
    reducer,
    getInitialState({ decay, impulse }),
  )
  const { status } = state

  // ...

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (status === 'idle') return

    const id = setInterval(() => {
      dispatch(TICK)
    }, FPS)

    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [status])

  // ...
}
```

Now we no longer `TICK` unless the game is `running`, which should reduce re-renders as well.

### Next steps

Here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas you could implement next:

- Add a `threshold` and determine if the game has been `won`
- Add a `timer` and `countdown`
- Add multiplayer with something like [PartyKit]()
- Add "modifiers" like I did in my ADHD post

I'm sure you can think of even more.
