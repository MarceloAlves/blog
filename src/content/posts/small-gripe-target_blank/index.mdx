I'm often asked to make small, almost trivial changes to our clients' websites. One of these changes that grinds my gears is the frequent request to "Make this hyperlink open in a new tab/window."

This bothers me because it changes the default behavior of links and takes away the user's control over his or her browser. Default behavior of a link is to open in the current window. Now, every browser/system I know of provides the user with an action that can open a link in a new tab (for example, cmd + click on Mac will do this). Adding a `target="_blank"` to a link robs the user of this ability.

Clients' reason that opening a link in a new tab will prevent a customer from leaving a site prematurely and not converting a sale. Shouldn't we have faith that our customers will stick around and buy products if _they want to_? One might even reason that removing the default behavior might be discomforting enough to turn away users.

My thoughts, don't selfishly change default behavior if you don't have to.
