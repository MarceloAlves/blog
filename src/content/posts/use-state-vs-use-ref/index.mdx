When I discuss React with people, I often hear that others find `useRef` to be confusing. People are uncertain about when and why they should use it. They often opt to use `useState` instead when perhaps it's not the right choice. I think one way of gaining an understanding of `useRef` is to compare it with `useState`, so let's do that.

Before we get into the specific differences, I want to share a realization I recently had. I realized that the standard React Hooks come in four categories:

<div class="my-8">
  <HookCategories />
</div>

Notice that I put `useRef` in _two_ categories. It doesn't fall neatly into one or the other. It holds a bit of state, whatever value is assigned to `ref.current`, making it a "State Manager". But it's also a "Stabilizer" because changing the value of `ref.current` **does not** cause a component to update.

`useState`, on the other hand, is designed to update a component. <Marker content="That's kind of the whole point, ha." /> In fact, I like to help people understand `useState` better by showing them how to make a `useForceUpdate` hook with it.

If you have written React for long enough, or have had the chance to work or search through some class component code, you may have used or come across an invocation of `this.forceUpdate()`. React class components have a method, `forceUpdate`, that you can use to imperatively force a component to rerender. It was an escape hatch of last resort. The move to React Hooks meant we lost this escape hatch, right?

**Wrong**.

We can create that same imperative escape hatch function like so: <Marker content={`You can also find this code on my <a href="/snippets">Snippets</a> under <a href="/snippets/use-force-update">useForceUpdate()</a>.`} />

```javascript
const useForceUpdate = () => {
  const [, setState] = React.useState(true)
  const forceUpdate = React.useCallback(() => {
    setState(x => !x)
  }, [])

  return forceUpdate
}
```

Let's break this code down. First, we only destructure the state setter from the `useState` hook. <Marker content="With array destructuring, you can skip values at any index just be not declaring a variable name at that position." /> We don't actually _need_ the state, we just need it to change whenever we want to force an update. Next, we make a callback function, stabilize it with `useCallback`, and use a [function updater](/prefer-function-updaters-in-state-setters) to flip the boolean back and forth. We then return our function from the hook. If we include this in a component, which we will see soon enough, we can force it to update. Let's put this into practice.

As I've demonstrated before in my post on [React.memo](/using-react-memo-to-avoid-unnecessary-rerenders), one way to visually see that a component has updated is to give it a random background color with each render. Let's make a component that does just that. First, the `randomRGB` function: <Marker content={`This, too, can be found on my <a href="/snippets">Snippets</a> page under <a href="/snippets/random-rgb">randomRGB()</a>`} />

```javascript
const random255 = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 255)

const randomRGB = () => {
  const r = random255()
  const g = random255()
  const b = random255()

  return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
}
```

Next, we'll make a box with a "Force Update" button that uses `randomRGB`.

```jsx
function Box() {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: randomRGB(), padding: 10 }}>
      <button onClick={forceUpdate}>Force Update</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And let's see it in action.

<div class="my-8">
  <RandomBox client:load />
</div>

Neat. Now, hopefully it's clear what causes a rerender with `useState`. The question we must now ask ourselves is, "How does this relate to `useRef`?". Let's try to make a similar box, but use `useRef` instead. We'll have to create our own state updater to do this since `useRef` doesn't give us one.

```jsx
function RefBox() {
  const ref = React.useRef(true)
  const flip = React.useCallback(() => {
    ref.current = !ref.current
  }, [])

  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: randomRGB(), padding: 10 }}>
      <button onClick={flip}>Try to update</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<div class="my-8">
  <RefRandomBox client:load />
</div>

I bet you just clicked that button repeatedly and wondered if it's actually doing anything. I assure you it is, check your console. I snuck a `console.log` into `flip` on you.

`useRef` is a _mutable_ value store. In other words, we can imperatively update the `ref` by assigning a new value to `ref.current`. However, a component _does not_ update when `ref.current` changes. Some other kind of state update needs to happen in order for the component to rerender.

Let's make an example that combines these two features together. We'll make a box with a counter as a `ref`. We'll update that counter in the background and see the current value of that `ref` whenever we force the component to update.

```jsx
function BackgroundCounter() {
  const counter = React.useRef(0)
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      counter.current++
    }, 100)

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval)
    }
  }, [])

  const reset = () => {
    counter.current = 0
    forceUpdate()
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: randomRGB() }}>
      <div>{counter.current}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={forceUpdate} type="button">
          Force Update
        </button>
        <button onClick={reset} type="button">
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And let's see how that works.

<div class="my-8">
  <BackgroundCounter client:load />
</div>

Notice that the value displayed only updates when we force it to. It's been changing in the background this entire time, and yet, because it was a `ref`, the component never updates. It was probably a pretty big number the first time you updated it, too. It's been running since you started reading this article.

So when might we practically want to use `useRef`? Well, the answer is the combination of those facts, "Whenever we need a value that will always be available, can be changed when necessary, without updating the component." I know that seems unhelpful, but let's make another example.

`useRef` essentially allows us to create a value in closure for the lifetime of the component. If you need a refresher on [closures, I got you](/what-is-a-closure). Have you ever had an effect that you wanted to ensure only ran once? <Marker content="Be careful here. This might only be the behavior you <em>think</em> you want. This is the kind of thing where bugs quickly creep up." /> We can make a `useEffectOnlyOnce` hook by using a `ref`.

```javascript
function useEffectOnlyOnce(effect, dependencies) {
  const hasRun = React.useRef(false)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (hasRun.current) return

    hasRun.current = true
    effect()
  }, dependencies)
}
```

Or what about an effect that can only run _after_ a component has initially mounted?

```javascript
function useEffectAfterInitialMount(effect, dependencies) {
  const isMounted = React.useRef(false)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!isMounted.current) {
      isMounted.current = true
      return
    }

    effect()
  }, dependencies)
}
```

Or, I don't know, what about an effect that only runs every `nth` time because you just want to be silly?

```javascript
function useEffectEveryNthTime(effect, dependencies, n) {
  const count = React.useRef(0)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    count.current++

    if (count.current % n === 0) {
      effect()
    }
  }, dependencies)
}
```

The point is a `ref` is very useful when you need to track a value for the lifetime of a component but don't need it's every change to update the UI. If you need that, you probably need to use a different state manager hook.

### Summary

Changing `useState`'s value will always cause a rerender, even if that state isn't used anywhere in the component. Changing `useRef`'s value will never cause a rerender, even if you use that state somewhere in the component.

`useRef` is useful for having a stable reference to a value throughout the lifetime of a component. It is a mutable value held in the closure of your component function and can be used by the functions created in the body of the component function.
