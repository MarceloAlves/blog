import { Box, ChildrenExample, NoChildrenExample } from './_Examples'

**It wasn't**. I just wanted your attention. Thanks.

And now while I have it, I do want to discuss a bit of common confusion caused by JSX.

One of the most common misunderstandings I run into with people regarding React is this: If a component has a state change and rerenders, it _does not_ cause `children` to rerender. I think this is very obvious when we _remove_ JSX, and use `React.createElement` instead. Let's have a look.

Here we have one of my favorite components to demonstrate rerenders, a `Box` that changes background color whenever it's rendered. This `Box` allows us to pass `children` through it. Thus, we'll make an `Example` where we force an update, which will cause `Box` to rerender.

```jsx
import { useForceUpdate } from './hooks'
import { randomRGB } from './utils'

function Box({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: randomRGB(), padding: '1rem' }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

function Example() {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return (
    <Box>
      <button type="button" onClick={forceUpdate}>
        Update
      </button>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

<div className="my-8">
  <OffsetWrap>
    <NoChildrenExample client:load />
  </OffsetWrap>
</div>

As you can see, clicking "Update" causes the `Box` to change colors. <Marker content="If you are visually impaired, I added a <code>data-background-color</code> attribute to the <code>div</code> that changes with it. I wasn't sure what else I could do, so I hope that helps. Please let me know if there's more I can do and I'll make an update." /> This is because `Box` is a _function_ that gets called when `Example` is called. This is obvious when instead of JSX, we use `React.createElement` instead.

```javascript
function Box({ children }) {
  return React.createElement('div', {
    style: { backgroundColor: randomRGB(), padding: '1rem' },
    children,
  })
}

function Example() {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return React.createElement(
    Box,
    null,
    React.createElement('button', { type: 'button', onClick: forceUpdate }),
  )
}
```

Notice that this time, we replaced `<div />` with `React.createElement('div')`. Then when we needed to render the `Box` in `Example`, we pass it to another call of `React.createElement`. Thus, each time `Example` rerenders, we call a function to render a `Box` and a function to render a `button`. Makes it pretty clear where functions are getting called.

### How does this relate to `children`?

Well, simply put, `children` is typically not a function call, it's just a value. <Marker content={`Yes, you can pass a function as <code>children</code> like the "render prop" pattern and that would be treated differently`} />

What if I add a "slot" for `children` in our `Example` component like this:

```javascript
function Example({ children }) {
  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()

  return React.createElement(
    Box,
    null,
    // createElement's third parameter is a rest parameter,
    // so we can add more items by adding more arguments
    React.createElement('button', { type: 'button', onClick: forceUpdate }),
    // here's the slot, it'll come after our button
    children,
  )
}
```

Now, what happens if we pass `Box` as `children` of our `Example`?

```jsx
<Example>
  <Box>I am a child</Box>
<Example>
```

<div className="my-8">
  <OffsetWrap>
    <ChildrenExample client:load>
      <Box client:load>I am a child</Box>
    </ChildrenExample>
  </OffsetWrap>
</div>

Notice that our child `Box` doesn't rerender, while the parent `Box` still does. It remains the same background color it was when it initially rendered, because it's not getting called again when `Example` rerenders.

Heck, let's have some fun and put `Example` into `Example`.

<div className="my-8">
  <OffsetWrap>
    <ChildrenExample client:load>
      <NoChildrenExample client:load />
    </ChildrenExample>
  </OffsetWrap>
</div>

Kind of fun, isn't it?

### When does this matter?

In most cases, I wouldn't fret about rerendering a `Box` or whatever component you might be working with, but it's just good knowledge to have. You'll be better off having this concept etched into your brain than not.

The place I'm most concerned about getting this right is the use of Context Providers. I wrote a very similar blog post [all about that](/careful-with-context-composition). Check it out if you're interested.

In general, if you have a component with frequent state changes and it uses `children`, consider letting as much of the inner contents be composed via `children` as possible to avoid unnecessary rendering.

You never know, you might just find your component is now a bit more reusable, too.
