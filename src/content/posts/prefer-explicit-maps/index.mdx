This tip is a bit of a weird one. I genuinely don't think others will like it, but I hope you'll hear me out. At the very least, it might make you think a bit.

I'm a big fan of [enumerated states](/enumerate-dont-booleanate). In TypeScript, a great way to represent this is a union of strings. Let's start with a basic one.

```typescript
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark'
```

It might be tempting to make this a boolean, given that there are only two states, but bear with me.

Now, let's make a `ThemeContext` we could use throughout our app.

```tsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext<Theme>('light')

function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState<Theme>('light')

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

So far, so good. Now, let's add a `toggleTheme` function to the context and export that. We'll need to make some adjustments.

```tsx
type ThemeContextValue = {
  theme: Theme
  toggleTheme: () => void
}

// ...

function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // ...

  const toggleTheme = React.useCallback(() => {
    // Here's the line to pay attention to
    setTheme(currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')
  })

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Do you see this line?

```typescript
setTheme(currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')
```

To use the parlance of the kids, I lowkey hate this line.

I'm not opposed to ternaries, but not all ternaries are the same. Some ternaries represent legitimate binary choices: `if` this, `else` that. But some ternaries are really "implicit maps".

A "map" is a data structure that pairs keys to values with a one-to-one relationship. This `key` always gives me this `value`. For example, we could create a `THEME_LABEL_MAP` if we needed to associate strings with our themes, like so:

```typescript
const THEME_LABEL_MAP: Record<Theme, string> = {
  dark: 'Dark',
  light: 'Light',
}
```

You can see we've established a one-to-one relationship between the key, a `Theme`, and a string. Our ternary from above does this, too, but not explicitly. If you squint hard enough, you can maybe see the `NEXT_THEME` map hidden in there. <Marker content="Astute readers might realize that we've created the world's smallest cyclical graph with <code>NEXT_THEME</code>, and I just think that's fun." />

```typescript
const NEXT_THEME: Record<Theme, Theme> = {
  dark: 'light',
  light: 'dark',
}
```

And this is actually how I prefer to write this code. Now our `toggleTheme` function will look a bit different:

```typescript
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(currentTheme => NEXT_THEME[currentTheme])
}
```

Doesn't that read nicely? Our map is practically a function, it's so elegant.

**"But why, Kyle? This seems like overkill!"**

Maybe it is. But let's say I had to add a third `Theme`: `high-contrast`. What does our ternary look like then?

```typescript
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(currentTheme =>
    currentTheme === 'light'
      ? 'dark'
      : currentTheme === 'dark'
        ? 'high-contrast'
        : 'light',
  )
}
```

I mean, to be fair, we could probably ditch the ternary and make it a bit nicer:

```typescript
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(currentTheme => {
    if (currentTheme === 'light') return 'dark'
    if (currentTheme === 'dark') return 'high-contrast'
    return 'light'
  })
}
```

But why go through all of that, when we could just update the map?

```typescript
const NEXT_THEME: Record<Theme, Theme> = {
  dark: 'high-contrast',
  'high-contrast': 'light',
  light: 'dark',
}
```

Our `toggleTheme` function doesn't have to change at all. `NEXT_THEME[currentTheme]` just keeps working. <Marker content="Although, perhaps it should be called <code>cycleTheme</code> to be more accurate." /> **Bonus points**: we didn't change the [cyclomatic complexity](/managing-cyclomatic-complexity) of our code at all either.

If we learn to pay attention, we can start to recognize situations where using an explicit map might be a simpler way for us to write and maintain our code.

### Key takeaways

- Consider when enumerating states might serve you better than a boolean
- Consider using explicit maps to reduce complexity and improve maintainability

### "Why didn't you use `new Map()`?"

Just to address anyone who might ask this: Yes, we could use `new Map()` to create "real" maps. However, I find the most compelling reason to use a `Map` is if you need to use something other than a string for a `key`s. Given that we were using strings for `key`s, I think its more appropriate and simple to just use an object literal.
