import HueLightBulb from './_HueLightBulb'

Before reading this post, I encourage you to read [How to Use `useReducer` as a Finite State Machine](/how-to-use-usereducer-as-a-finite-state-machine) if you haven't already. In that post, I demonstrate how to make the React Hook `useReducer` behave like a finite state machine using a statechart-like graph. I'm going to expand upon that work today.

The next thing we need to add to our `useReducer`-based finite state machine is contextual data. Not all data can be modeled as a set of finite states (nor should it). Consider the humble `<input />`. A user can provide an infinite number of strings as a `value` to the input. By definition, we cannot model the infinite with the finite, and thus we need a way to store infinite contextual data in our machine. It will be very useful to us when we add guards and conditions in a future post.

In XState, infinite state data is stored on the `context` object of the state machine. Because React also has a concept of `context` and I do not wish to conflate the two concepts, so I will simply call this `data`. This means that our state machine's `state` is not the only thing being returned by our `reducer` anymore, and so we need a name for that as well. In this post, I will call this `current`, as in the "current state". Let's make these our first changes to our state machine. We'll continue to use the `LightBulb` from the previous post as the object that we are modeling.

```jsx
const initial = {
  current: 'unlit',
  data: {},
}

//...

const reducer = (state, event) => {
  const { current } = state
  const nextState = NEXT_STATE_GRAPH[current][event]

  return nextState !== undefined ? nextState : state
}

//...

function LightBulb() {
  const [state, send] = useReducer(reducer, initial)
  const { current } = state

  return (
    <div>
      State: {current}
      <button type="button" onClick={() => send('TOGGLE')}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => send('BREAK')}>
        Break
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Our light bulb continues to work as it did before, so now let's modify it so that we need to store some `data` and make use of it. Here is the specification we're going to build into our reducer:

- If the `nextState` is `undefined`, do not update the `current` state or `data`
- Otherwise, update the `state` and update the `data` if necessary

Let's modify our `reducer` to accommodate this:

```javascript
const reducer = (state, event) => {
  const { current, data } = state
  const nextState = NEXT_STATE_GRAPH[current][event]

  if (!nextState) return state

  const nextData = data // we need to write the code that will update this still

  return {
    current: nextState,
    data: nextData,
  }
}
```

We've laid the foundation for updating `data` in response to an `event`, but our code does not support passing `data` along with an `event` yet. At the moment, an `event` is merely a string. We need to be able to pass more information along with the event. How can we support being able to use a string for an event, and also pass `data` with it?

By making every `event` an object under the hood.

This is one of my favorite features of XState and a pattern that's easy to borrow. All we need to do is turn an `event` like `TOGGLE` into an object like `{ type: 'TOGGLE' }` under the hood. This will allow the user to supply simple strings if no data needs to be on the event, or an object with the additional data. We accomplish this by normalizing the events into the same shape.

```javascript
const toEventObject = event =>
  typeof event === 'string' ? { type: event } : event
```

We now use `toEventObject` in our `reducer` to normalize the `event` before using it to determine the `nextState`.

```javascript
const reducer = (state, event) => {
  event = toEventObject(event)
  const { current, data } = state
  const nextState = NEXT_STATE_GRAPH[current][event.type]

  if (!nextState) return state

  const nextData = data

  return {
    current: nextState,
    data: nextData,
  }
}
```

Now that we've normalized the `event` into an object, we'll be able to pass along extra data on that object when we `send` `event`s to our machine. Let's modify our example so that our `LightBulb` needs some contextual data. Let's add `color` to our light bulb so that when it's `lit`, we can change the `color` with a `CHANGE_COLOR` event.

This is where I'm going to introduce several things and start to make some deviations from XState, so bear with me.

We now have an event that will not change the state of the light bulb. Sending a `CHANGE_COLOR` event should keep us in a `lit` state. Since our state graph depends on having a defined value for an event, we need to add the `CHANGE_COLOR` event to our `NEXT_STATE_GRAPH` object. I'm going to add a `RESET` event while we're at it, and use [object spreading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals) to dry up some events that are used in multiple states.

```javascript
const BREAK_EVENT = { BREAK: 'broken' }
const RESET_EVENT = { RESET: initialState.current }

const NEXT_STATE_GRAPH = {
  lit: {
    ...BREAK_EVENT,
    ...RESET_EVENT,
    CHANGE_COLOR: 'lit', // Notice we stay in the same state
    TOGGLE: 'unlit',
  },
  unlit: {
    ...BREAK_EVENT,
    ...RESET_EVENT,
    TOGGLE: 'lit',
  },
  broken: {
    ...RESET_EVENT,
  },
}
```

We also need a way for `CHANGE_COLOR` to trigger an update to our `data`. The way I'm choosing to do this is with an object called `DATA_UPDATERS`. Each `updater` function will receive the current `data` and the `event` that triggered the `updater` call.

```javascript
const DATA_UPDATERS = {
  CHANGE_COLOR: (data, event) => ({ ...data, color: event.color }),
  RESET: () => initial.data,
}
```

Now, we need to update our `reducer` to actually use our `DATA_UPDATERS`. I'm going to make a slight refactor here as I do it where I will "split the loops" of our state reduction and our data reduction into two separate reducers.

```javascript
const stateReducer = (state, event) =>
  NEXT_STATE_GRAPH[state.current][event.type]

const dataReducer = (data, event) => {
  const updater = DATA_UPDATERS[event.type]
  return updater ? updater(data, event) : data
}

const reducer = (state, event) => {
  event = toEventObject(event)
  const nextState = stateReducer(state, event)

  if (!nextState) return state

  const nextData = dataReducer(state.data, event)

  return {
    current: nextState,
    data: nextData,
  }
}
```

Now we can add some UI to our `HueLightBulb` that supports changing colors.

```jsx
const EVENTS = ['TOGGLE', 'BREAK', 'RESET']
const COLORS = [
  { name: 'white', value: '#feffeb' },
  { name: 'red', value: '#ff674f' },
  { name: 'blue', value: '#5cb6ff' },
  { name: 'green', value: '#8ff244' },
]

function HueLightBulb() {
  const [state, send] = useReducer(reducer, initial)
  const { current, data } = state

  return (
    <div>
      <span>State: {current}</span> <span>Color: {data.color}</span>
      <div>
        <span>Events</span>
        <div>
          {EVENTS.map(event => (
            <button key={event} type="button" onClick={() => send(event)}>
              {event}
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Change colors</span>
        <div>
          {COLORS.map(({ name, value }) => (
            <button
              key={name}
              type="button"
              onClick={() => send({ type: 'CHANGE_COLOR', color: value })}
            >
              {name}
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we're able to change the colors of our bulb, but only when we are in the `lit` state. We have a `useReducer`-based state machine that can handle infinite state data!

I made a component for you to play with that contains a few extra bells and whistles, including some SVGs that I made <Marker content="Be kind. I don't really have any vector art skills whatsoever" /> to show all the states of our bulb.

<HueLightBulb client:load />

If you prefer to tinker with the code itself, an iteration of this example exists on Codesandbox for you to fork: [https://codesandbox.io/s/usereducer-fsm-with-infinite-states-v2b1g](https://codesandbox.io/s/usereducer-fsm-with-infinite-states-v2b1g)

### Conclusion

Infinite data cannot be modeled as a finite set of states, but we still want to have the control and guarantees a state machine gives us about our program. We can achieve this by storing this extra `data` in our `state`. We can make updates to this `data` through `event` objects. We only make updates to our `data` when our state graph allows it, and we guarantee the deterministic output of our `state` through reducers for our `current` state and our `data`.

In a future post, we'll add the concept of guards to our state machine that will require some modifications to how we think of our contextual `data`, but I hope this continues to inspire your imagination on how to write more robust programs in the mean time.
