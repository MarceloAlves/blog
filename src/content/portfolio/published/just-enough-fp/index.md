In 2017, I became fascinated with functional programming and gave a version of this talk internally at Fastly, at Google Developer's Group Silicon Valley conference, at Donut.js in Portland, and finally at O'Reilly's Fluent Conf in San Jose. I've really enjoyed helping people learn just enough functional programming to get started!
