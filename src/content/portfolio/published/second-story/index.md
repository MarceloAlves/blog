Second Story got a new look recently. I built their new brand site as a universal (isomorphic) React & Redux application.

This was my first opportunity to use React & Redux in production. I absolutely loved working with this stack. My hope is to focus on using these tools for the foreseeable future.

One of the technical challenges of this project was the floating logo. I had to create a React component that tracked the position of sections of the website to detect collisions. If a collision occurs, the logo flips from black to white. Something so simple was actually quite challenging to do. Hope you enjoy the site.
