I will be giving a talk on React and Redux near the end of March and wanted to come up with a simple, but fun, project to showcase how these applications are built. I recently came across the concept of a Fibonacci Clock. It's a way of telling time in 5 minute increments using the Fibonacci sequence. I thought it would be interesting to try and code up the application, and it was.

This application utilizes Redux for the entire application state, has some options for you to play with. Even the instructions update as you choose different color schemes. Overall, this was a blast to create and simple enough for someone to try and build on their own.
