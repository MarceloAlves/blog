With the popularity of CSS-in-JS growing, I rewrote my Shevy library in JavaScript to be used by a variety of CSS-in-JS libraries. I've used it in several projects, including this very blog. Makes setting up typography a breeze and is incredibly useful in setting paddings and margins throughout a project using the `baseSpacing` method that ShevyJS ships with.

Read more about ShevyJS in my blog post [introducing the library](/shevyjs).
