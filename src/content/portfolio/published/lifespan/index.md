Lifespan is a simple React app based on [Tim Urban's TED talk on procrastination](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en). Near the end of the talk, he displayed a visual where each week in a 90-year lifespan was represented as a small circle. I wanted to recreate this visual, but add a small amount of interactivity. I hope you're not too overcome with anxiety about your mortality to play with the app and look through the code.
