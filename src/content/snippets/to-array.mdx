`toArray` is a helper function that takes a value, and always returns an array of that value. I think this snippet is best understood with types, so even though the category is JavaScript, I'm going to write it both in plain JavaScript and TypeScript in my code snippet.

```typescript
// JavaScript
function toArray(value) {
  return Array.isArray(value) ? value : [value]
}

// TypeScript
function toArray<Value>(value: Value | Value[]): Value[] {
  return Array.isArray(value) ? value : [value]
}
```

This is primarily useful in two situations. First, when a function might return you a single value or an array of values. I would argue that the API should _always_ return an array, but you don't always control that. With `toArray` you can normalize the result. A recent example I've run into is `next/router` returning `string | string[]` for params.

```javascript
const router = useRouter()
let { id } = router.query // could be string | string[]
id = toArray(id) // guaranteed to be string[]
```

The second is when you want to provide the consumer of a function a shorthand for a single item. The first example that comes to mind is the [XState library](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate). In fact, the source code for it is where I learned this trick.

The XState API frequently has places where you can pass a `string` or an array of `string`s. When you pass in a single string, under the hood, the argument is passed to `toArray` so that the rest of the function can treat it like an array.

```javascript
{
  // imagine we're in a statechart
  active: {
    on: {
      DEACTIVATE: {
        target: 'inactive',
        actions: 'someSideEffect', // same as ['someSideEffect']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I should write a full blog post on this someday, but the benefit of normalizing a value to an array is not needing to bifurcate your logic on whether you're operating over one item or many. Wrap it in an array and `map`, `filter` and loop your way to your necessary result _regardless_ of how many items are being operated on.
