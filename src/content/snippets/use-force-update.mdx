In React, a component will update whenever state is updated. So all we need to make an update happen is call a `setState` with a new value. Simplest way to do this is flip a boolean.

```javascript
const useForceUpdate = () => {
  const [, setState] = React.useState(true)
  const forceUpdate = React.useCallback(() => {
    setState(s => !s)
  }, [])

  return forceUpdate
}
```

This can be useful when using `useRef`. Changes to `ref`s won't trigger a component to update. Calling `forceUpdate` after setting a `ref` may be the trick you're looking for. <Marker content="Arguably, there may be a better way to do what you're trying to achieve, perhaps with a <code>useEffect</code> hook instead." />
