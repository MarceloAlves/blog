<Note>

Credit where credit is due! I originally learned this technique from Josh W.
Comeau. [His component snippet is a React component](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-components/shift-by/). Mine is an Astro
component. I'm adding this simply to have code that I can copy/paste for _either_ framework in the future, via his site or mine.

Sometimes, for one reason or another, an element in our UI might refuse to align properly. `ShiftBy` is a way to wrangle it into alignment.

Simply wrap your component with a `ShiftBy` and make pixel adjustments, positively or negatively.

```astro
---
type Props = {
  /**
   * Adjusts the children left and right.
   * Negative values go left, positive values go right
   */
  x?: number
  /**
   * Adjusts the children up and down.
   * Negative values go up, positive values go down
   */
  y?: number
}

const { x = 0, y = 0 } = Astro.props
---

<div style={`transform: translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`}>
  <slot />
</div>
```

And use it like so:

```astro
---
import { Icon, ShiftBy } from '~/components'
---

<ShiftBy x={1} y={-3}>
  <Icon name="search" />
</ShiftBy>
```
