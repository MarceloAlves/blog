```javascript
const indexByKey = key => arr =>
  arr.reduce((acc, cur) => {
    acc[cur[key]] = cur
    return acc
  }, {})
```

Use this function to make look ups based on a key for an array of items `O(1)`. So long as your list doesn't change, you should only have to run this once.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const indexById = indexByKey('id')

const members = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Kyle' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Krios' }, // my cat
  { id: 3, name: 'Tali' }, //  my other cat
]

const membersById = indexById(members)
/*
  {
    '1': { id: 1, name: 'Kyle' },
    '2': { id: 2, name: 'Krios' },
    '3': { id: 3, name: 'Tali' }
  }
*/
```

Make sure the key you're using is unique to each object, otherwise you'll have an incorrect index due to `key` collisions.
