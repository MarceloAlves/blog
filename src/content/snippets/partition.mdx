The other day I wanted to filter an array into two separate arrays. I'll make a trivial example:

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// The 1s and 0s are coerced into trues and falses respectively
const odds = nums.filter(n => n % 2)
const evens = nums.filter(n => !(n % 2))
```

From a big-O notation perspective, it's more than likely fine to do this loop twice. It would take a rather large array to make this very problematic. That said, it's undeniably frustrating that we can't already get the _other_ items from `.filter()`. Hence, `partition`.

I didn't know this was in `lodash` before I set out to write the function (but that's where I got the name), so feel free to use that version instead. My version is curried for funsies. Slap the arguments together if you prefer.

```javascript
const partition = predicate => array =>
  array.reduce(
    (acc, cur) => {
      predicate(cur) ? acc[0].push(cur) : acc[1].push(cur)
      return acc
    },
    [[], []]
  )
```

Using `reduce`, we can do a single pass through the array, calling the `predicate` function for each item <Marker content="A <code>predicate</code> is a function that returns a <code>boolean</code>" />. As we loop through our items, we build up a tuple. The first array in the tuple are the `true`s, the second, the `false`s. Using our example from before:

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

const [odds, evens] = partition(n => n % 2)(nums)
```

And there you have it.
