Often nouns need slight changes depending on the quantity of that noun. Example: One person, several people. I call these differences "inflections". The `inflect` function below is a little helper function I use to help me apply inflections in my application.

```javascript
const inflect =
  (singular, plural = `${singular}s`) =>
  quantity =>
    Math.abs(quantity) === 1 ? singular : plural
```

`inflect` is a higher order function, meaning it's a function that returns a function. If you need some info on higher order functions, check out [my post on them](/just-enough-fp-higher-order-functions) and the post on [currying](/just-enough-fp-currying).

This solution makes use of [default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) for the `plural` argument. If adding an "s" is all you need to make a plural, then you don't need to provide it. Like this:

```javascript
const inflectPost = inflect('post')

console.log(inflectPost(1)) // 'post'
console.log(inflectPost(2)) // 'posts'
```

But often plurals have oddities (like "person" and "people"), so you can supply a `plural` argument when you need it.

```javascript
const inflectMouse = inflect('mouse', 'mice')
const inflectKnife = inflect('knife', 'knives')
// etc
```

Now, as helpful as this is, it is _not_ a proper solution should you need internationalization. Treat this is a helper function for those instances this can support.
