30 minutes.

30 minutes is about all I get each day, between finishing the minutiae of starting the day and starting work, where I can use my focus and energy (while I have any at all) on myself.

**It's not enough**.

Some things in life can be accomplished piecemeal 30 minutes at a time. Reading a book. Adding this section to my website. Writing this first post.

But, in my experience, there are far more things that don't fit that schedule at all. Or perhaps worse, there is always more than 30 minutes of things to do that _deserve_ your best.

I want more than 30 minutes. This is my one and only life, after all.
