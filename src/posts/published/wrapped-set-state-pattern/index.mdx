Today, in the process of working on what might potentially become a course on React, I used a pattern that I've found useful from time to time that I want to share with you.

Have you ever wanted to have something happen _every_ time you use `setState` in React? Perhaps you wanted a way to finagle the `nextState` or wanted to run a side effect where you store the value in `localStorage`. We can accomplish this and more with a "wrapped state setter" pattern.

Since my example app for the potential course uses `localStorage` in lieu of a database, I'll use that for my example code. That said, the pattern is the same regardless of what you use it for, so let's dive in.

Let's say my app stores a collection of notes:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState([])
  //...
}
```

Now, let's add some [declarative state updaters](/prefer-declarative-state-updaters) that will update our notes. Keep in mind, there are multiple ways to write these updaters. Don't get too focused on the implementation details, just recognize we've written a few. Like so:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState([])

  const createNote = note => {
    setNotes(currentNotes => [...currentNotes, note])
  }

  const updateNote = update => {
    setNotes(currentNotes => {
      const index = currentNotes.findIndex(note => note.id === update.id)

      if (index < 0) return currentNotes

      return [
        ...currentNotes.slice(0, index),
        { ...currentNotes[index], ...update },
        ...currentNotes.slice(index + 1),
      ]
    })
  }

  const deleteNote = id => {
    setNotes(currentNotes => {
      const index = currentNotes.findIndex(note => note.id === id)

      if (index < 0) return currentNotes

      return [...currentNotes.slice(0, index), ...currentNotes.slice(index + 1)]
    })
  }

  //...
}
```

Now, let's say that we want to store these changes to `notes` in `localStorage` _every_ time we make an update. What is the simplest way to do this?

If we look at all our declarative updaters, they all make a call to `setNotes`. If we had a way to change `setNotes`, we could make this happen. This is where the "wrapped" part of the title comes in.

We're going to create a higher order function that will use `setNotes` in its closure to continue to have the current behavior, while providing us an opportunity to extend that behavior to our benefit. Let's wrap it up, like so:

```javascript
const wrappedSetNotes = React.useCallback(update => {
  setNotes(currentNotes => {
    const nextState =
      typeof update === 'function' ? update(currentNotes) : update

    localStorage.setItem(YOUR_LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(nextState))

    return nextState
  })
}, [])
```

And then every where we previously called `setNotes`, we update to `wrappedSetNotes`:

```javascript
const createNote = note => {
  wrappedSetNotes(currentNotes => [...currentNotes, note])
}

const updateNote = update => {
  wrappedSetNotes(currentNotes => {
    const index = currentNotes.findIndex(note => note.id === update.id)

    if (index < 0) return currentNotes

    return [
      ...currentNotes.slice(0, index),
      { ...currentNotes[index], ...update },
      ...currentNotes.slice(index + 1),
    ]
  })
}

const deleteNote = id => {
  wrappedSetNotes(currentNotes => {
    const index = currentNotes.findIndex(note => note.id === id)

    if (index < 0) return currentNotes

    return [...currentNotes.slice(0, index), ...currentNotes.slice(index + 1)]
  })
}
```

Now, any updates that we make to `notes` will have the side effect of updating the value in `localStorage`.

There are other ways to use this pattern. If you've ever heard of the "state reducer pattern", that's an example of wrapping the state setter.

This pattern also doesn't have to be _just_ for state setters. If ever you find yourself with a function that you want to add some functionality to, you might be able to simply wrap it in a function, and add your functionality in the function body. Try it out, see if it works.
