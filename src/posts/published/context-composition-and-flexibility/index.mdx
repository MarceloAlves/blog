import { OurInput, OurInputStyleProvider } from './OurInput'

Recently, I had the following situation at work. It has been adapted to be **less** professional and **more** humorous:

<hr />

**Designer**: Hey, you know our `Input` component?

**Me**: Yeah, this one?

<Margin vertical={2}>
  <OurInput id="ours" label="Our Input Component" />
</Margin>

**Designer**: Yeah, that's the one! Look, I want you to make it so that when the `Input` is optional, it shows a little bit of helper text to the right of label that says `"(optional)"`. Like this:

<Margin vertical={2}>
  <OurInputStyleProvider variant="showOptionals">
    <OurInput id="ours" label="Our Input Component" />
  </OurInputStyleProvider>
</Margin>

**Me**: Oh, you wouldn't prefer to show an asterisk when it's _required_ like almost every other website in existence? Like this:

<Margin vertical={2}>
  <OurInputStyleProvider variant="showRequireds">
    <OurInput id="ours" label="Our Required Input Component" required />
  </OurInputStyleProvider>
</Margin>

**Designer**: Well, most of our `Input`s should be required so we felt that this would be less noisy. Don't want to see `*`s everywhere.

**Me**: But every `Input` in all our apps, and all the web actually, is optional **by default**. You have to set the `required` attribute explicitly. Meaning the more likely scenario is seeing `"(optional)"` everywhere.

**Designer**: Yeah... I don't care. Just do it.

<hr />

Now, if you've done software engineering for any significant amount of time, you've probably run into a scenario just like this one. It sucks to be told to do something that you know isn't the right solution.

That said, in this particular scenario, there's a pretty easy way for both of us to win and I'm hoping it will give you some more strategies when you're in a similar situation again in the future. Let me show you how.

### First instincts vs. second thoughts

Given the nature of the change, it would be really tempting to solve it as simply as possible, perhaps like this:

```jsx
function Input({ id, label, required = false }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>
        {label}
        {!required && ' (optional)'}
      </label>
      <input id={id} required={required} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This definitely solves the problem, but we know that this isn't a great solution. It's likely to get push back from other teams who want something they're more accustomed to, like an `*` on required fields.

We might be tempted to change it so that `Input` receives a `variant` that determines how to handle this, perhaps like this:

```jsx
function Input({ id, label, required = false, variant = 'showOptionals' }) {
  const getHelperText = () => {
    if (variant === 'showOptionals' && !required) return ' (optional)'
    if (variant === 'showRequireds' && required) return '*'

    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>
        {label}
        {getHelperText()}
      </label>
      <input id={id} required={required} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, if a team wants to show a more traditional `*` on their required inputs, they can add the `variant="showRequired"` prop. **However**, this would mean needing to add that to _every single `Input` that needs that treatment_. That's laborious, exhausting and tedious.

What if there was a way to apply a `variant` to every input, but only have to write it once?

### Context and composition to the rescue

Let's create an `InputStyleContext` that will pass the `variant` to all consumers automatically.

```javascript
const InputStyleContext = React.createContext()

function InputStyleProvider({ children, variant = 'none' }) {
  return (
    <InputStyleContext.Provider value={variant}>
      {children}
    </InputStyleContext.Provider>
  )
}

const useInputStyleContext = () => React.useContext(InputStyleContext)
```

Now that we have that, let's use the custom hook we made to get the `variant` off of context, rather than passed in as a prop to `Input`.

```jsx
function Input({ id, label, required = false }) {
  const variant = useInputStyleContext()

  const getHelperText = () => {
    if (variant === 'showOptionals' && !required) return ' (optional)'
    if (variant === 'showRequireds' && required) return '*'

    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>
        {label}
        {getHelperText()}
      </label>
      <input id={id} required={required} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we have the option to change the appearance of our `Input`s with a single wrapping component. You want the `"(optional)"` text, do this:

```jsx
<InputStyleProvider variant="showOptionals">
  <Input id="name" label="Name" />
</InputStyleProvider>
```

Or if you want to show `*` on required fields, change the `variant` to `showRequireds`. It's that simple.

```jsx
<InputStyleProvider variant="showRequireds">
  <Input id="name" label="Name" required />
</InputStyleProvider>
```

Now we have a solution that has satiated our designer, but gives us some flexibility still. I think that's a win-win.

Try to remember that context and composition might be a good solution for your problem, too.

### And for the record...

The very first form I worked on after this change was, in fact, 5 `Input`s, all optional, all with the `"(optional)"` text next to them. So much for being less noisy! Oh well.
