When I was a kid, I used to go to my neighbor's house to play Mortal Kombat on their Sega Genesis. Occasionally between fights, you'd get to play a mini-game called "Test Your Might". I've been thinking about this game a lot for the last year or so.

In the game, your character stood before a block of material, such as wood or stone, and attempted to break it in half. Your "might" was a power bar, and your job was to mash the buttons fast enough to charge the power bar before the time limit finished and your character dropped their fist and tried breaking the material. As the materials got harder, the difficulty of charging the bar got harder.

The reason I've been thinking about this so much is that it's a pretty apt metaphor for comparing neurotypical brains and ADHD brains.

For those of you who don't know much about ADHD, it stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but it's not really an accurate name given what we understand about the condition now. A more apt name might be something like Dopamine Dysregulation Disorder. Fundamentally, the ADHD brain has lower levels of dopamine and struggles to regulate what it does have.
