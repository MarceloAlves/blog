# kyleshevlin.com

Welcome to the repo for [kyleshevlin.com](https://kyleshevlin.com). This is my personal site where I share my work and ideas.

The blog is open source for a few reasons:

- It allows me to share the blog, in part or in whole, as an example when necessary
- It allows contributors to help out by fixing mistakes, typos, or updating outdated information

## Contributing

If you find a typo or a mistake and would like to contribute, you may do so by submitting a PR with the fix.

If you are looking for a post, it is somewhere under `src/content/posts`. Doing a search under there will lead you to the right post. My apologies that directory names do not always match the eventual title of the blog. The idea I start writing does not always end up being the same as the finished post.

If you make a contribution that is merged into `main`, your Github avatar will be displayed on each of my blog posts as a thank you for your work. If you would prefer your avatar not be displayed, please let me know so I can work out a way to achieve that.

## Theft

I am just going to come out and say it. It is totally possible that an open source blog like this could be stolen and re-shared somewhere on the internet. In general, I am not terribly concerned about this. That said, if you happen to come across _blatant_ theft of my work, please let me know on [Twitter in a DM](https://twitter.com/kyleshevlin).

## Thanks

If you're here and reading this, I just want to say thank you. I hope you find something useful here. If you do, please share about it on your platform of choice. It's the best way for others to discover it, too.
